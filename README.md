# superfun-fullscreen-animations
I developed this app to show fullscreen reactions to my coworkers while sharing my screen on Teams. Or in person, that looks fun too.

This electon app runs in the background and shows full screen html/css/javascript animations when a configurable keyboard shortcut is pressed (by default, shorcuts are Control+NumpadNumbers).
Animations are made with javascript and css, the favorite degisn and a animation tools of any backend developer like me. Duplicate an animaiton folder to make a new animation and add the shortcut to main.js.

# Installation:
You will need to install node.js and run "npm install electron" in the project folder. It may complain quite a lot about version mismatches but everything may end working just fine in the end.
That will add at least 250MB of stuff for very valid reasons and each file is indispensable to run the superfun fullscreen animations.

Once installation finishes, run the "start.bat" file (if you use a good OS) or "npm start" command. Good luck, you will need it.

I accept pull requests of new, cool and funny animations.
